# Tableau_Dashboard

Every year, the Government in India releases the Economic Survey and the Statistical Appendix which contains the entirety of data collected by the Government across multiple fields such as finance, industries, banking, agriculture, health and education, and so on. This data is released in a pdf as well as csv format on the official economic survey website and can be acsessed as such.

This raw data is a goldmine of information and if processed and visualised properly, can undiscover a plethora of new insights into the inner workings of the Indian economy. The data although plenty is inconsistent and not standardised. Manual cleaning and formatting are required to clean, combine and process this data to make it usable. 

After this data modelling, the data is fed into tableau and the process of uncovering insights begins. The data has been combined into 7 key sectors with further sub sections namely:
